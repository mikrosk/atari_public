RaSCSI Client Tools
-------------------

The client tools require a RaSCSI board and release 22.04 or newer of the
RaSCSI software. In addition, a SCSI Driver is required, e.g. the one
integrated in HDDRIVER.
The client tools C sources are available on GitHub:
https://github.com/uweseimet/atari_public.
Visit https://www.rascsi.de for details on the RaSCSI board and the RaSCSI
Control app for Android.

In order to use RA_RTC und RA_SHUTD with RaSCSI a host services device
(device type SCHS) with an arbitrary SCSI ID and a LUN < 0 has to be created.
This can be done with RaSCSI the web interface, the RaSCSI Control app or on
the command line, e.g.

>rascsi -ID 6 services

RA_PRINT requires a SCSI printer (device type SCLP) with an arbitrary SCSI
ID and a LUN < 8 to be created. This can also happen with the web interface,
the RaSCSI Control app or on the command line, e.g.

>rascsi -ID 5 printer

All client tools find the respective device automatically. If there are
several devices the first device found is used. Like for any other device,
the SCSI IDs/LUNs used have to be configured in HDDRUTIL with "Devices and
Partitions".


RA_RTC.PRG
----------

This tool retrieves the current date and time from RaSCSI and sets it on the
Atari. Daylight savings time settings are automatically applied. Usually
RA_RTC is located in the AUTO folder.


RA_SHUTD.PRG
------------

This tool shuts down the Pi. Note that RA_SHUTD terminates immediately, but
the Pi takes some time to shut down. RA_SHUTD cannot find out when the Pi has
completely shut down. After using RA_SHUTD it is not possible anymore to
access the devices emulated by RaSCSI.
If "rascsi" is passed as a parameter only RaSCSI is shut down, but not the
Pi. If "reboot" is passed the Pi is restarted.


RA_PRINT.TTP
------------

With this tool files can be printed via RaSCSI. Usually you wcreate an icon
for RA_PRINT on the desktop, onto which you drop the file to be printed. As
an alternative you can launch RA_PRINT manually and enter the filename.
RA_PRINT requires that a printing system (e.g. CUPS) is available on the Pi.
The printer configured on the Pi has to be compatible with the
printer driver used for creating the file to be printed on the Atari. With
the RaSCSI SCSI printer default settings RaSCSI sends all data to the
actual printer without modifying them.
Due to technical reasons it is not possible to directly print via SCSI
without using a file.
RA_PRINT was only tested with the RaSCSI SCSI printer, but might also work
with other printers, which are compatible with the SCSI-2 specification.
