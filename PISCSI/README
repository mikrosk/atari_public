PiSCSI Client Tools
-------------------

The client tools require a RaSCSI/PiSCSI board and release 22.04 or newer
of the RaSCSI/PiSCSI software. In addition, a SCSI Driver is required, e.g.
the one integrated in HDDRIVER.
The client tools C sources are available on GitHub:
https://github.com/uweseimet/atari_public.
Visit https://www.piscsi.de for details on PiSCSI and the PiSCSI Control app
for Android.

In order to use PI_RTC und PI_SHUTD with PiSCSI a host services device
(device type SCHS) with an arbitrary SCSI ID and a LUN < 0 has to be created.
This can be done with PiSCSI the web interface, the PiSCSI Control app or on
the command line, e.g.

>piscsi -ID 6 services

PI_PRINT requires a SCSI printer (device type SCLP) with an arbitrary SCSI
ID and a LUN < 8 to be created. This can also happen with the web interface,
the PiSCSI Control app or on the command line, e.g.

>piscsi -ID 5 printer

All client tools find the respective device automatically. If there are
several devices the first device found is used. Like for any other device,
the SCSI IDs/LUNs used have to be configured in HDDRUTIL with "Devices and
Partitions".


PI_RTC.PRG
----------

This tool retrieves the current date and time from PiSCSI and sets it on the
Atari. Daylight savings time settings are automatically applied. Usually
PI_RTC is located in the AUTO folder.


PI_SHUTD.PRG
------------

This tool shuts down PiSCSI or the Pi. Note that PI_SHUTD terminates
immediately, but the Pi takes some time to shut down. PI_SHUTD cannot find
out when the Pi has completely shut down. After launching PI_SHUTD it is not
possible anymore to access the devices emulated by PiSCSI.
If "piscsi" is passed as a parameter only PiSCSI is shut down, but not the Pi.
With "reboot" the Pi is restarted.


PI_PRINT.TTP
------------

With this tool files can be printed via PiSCSI. Usually you create an icon
for PI_PRINT on the desktop, onto which you drop the file to be printed. As
an alternative you can launch PI_PRINT manually and enter the filename.
PI_PRINT requires that a printing system (e.g. CUPS) is active on the Pi.
The printer configured on the Pi has to be compatible with the
printer driver used for creating the file to be printed on the Atari. With
the PiSCSI SCSI printer default settings PiSCSI sends all data to the
printer without modifying them.
Due to technical reasons it is not possible to directly print via SCSI
without using a file.
PI_PRINT was only tested with the PiSCSI SCSI printer, but might also work
with other SCSI printers compatible with the SCSI-2 specification.
