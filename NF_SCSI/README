NF_SCSI - SCSI Driver for Hatari and ARAnyM
-------------------------------------------

This is the SCSI Driver for Hatari and ARAnyM. The SCSI Driver standard is
an open software interface for the Atari and was initiated by Steffen Engel.
Please refer to https://www.hddriver.net/en/downloads.html for further
information.

The SCSI Driver for Hatari and ARAnyM implements a SCSI Driver on top of the
Linux SG 3 driver interface. With this driver Hatari and ARAnyM can access
all devices supported by the Linux SG driver. (Note that NVMe devices are
not supported by the Linux SG driver.) The Linux user needs the proper
permissions to access the SG device files /dev/sg*. Depending on the Linux
distribution one may have to belong to the groups 'disk' and 'cdrom', for
instance.

The SCSI Driver for Hatari and ARAnyM implements the SCSI Driver interface
version 1.01. It consists of three software components:

1. Native SCSI Driver host implementation, which for Linux is provided by
   Hatari and ARAnyM with their latest development versions. It maps SCSI
   Driver calls to  Linux SG driver calls. In order to run the SCSI Driver
   stub for TOS on other platforms than Linux, this is the code that has to
   be ported.
2. SCSI Driver stub for TOS, NF_SCSI.PRG. This component runs under TOS and
   uses the NatFeats interface to call the host driver. The stub is
   independent of the host platform.

By renaming NF_SCSI.PRG to HDDRMODn.SYS it can be launched as HDDRIVER
module, which is automatically executed before HDDRIVER.SYS when booting
with future versions of HDDRIVER. See the HDDRIVER module README for
details.
   
In order to install the SCSI Driver either launch NF_SCSI.PRG, e.g. from the
AUTO folder of an emulated GEMDOS drive, or place the NF_SCSI driver as
HDDRMOD0.SYS in the root directory of the boot drive and configure HDDRIVER
to execute driver modules.
NF_SCSI implements a new SCSI Driver bus with bus ID 31. Optionally a
different bus ID can be passed as an argument when launching NF_SCSI.

The SCSI Driver provides low level device access for software that is aware
SCSI Drivers, like HDDRIVER, HDDRUTIL, DISKUS, ExtenDOS or GEMAR. In order
to get direct access to mass storage devices on filesystem level an Atari
hard disk driver with SCSI Driver support has to be run, e.g. HDDRIVER.
The SCSI Driver for Hatari and ARAnyM has successfully been tested with
HDDRIVER 9 and newer.

HDDRIVER automatically provides XHDI functionality for all mass storage
devices managed by SCSI Drivers that were launched before HDDRIVER.

The NatFeats-based interface between the TOS stub and the host driver
implementation consists of these calls (NatFeats sub-ids):

1. SCSI_INTERFACE_VERSION

Returns the driver interface version number. (Note that this is not the same
as the SCSI Driver version.) Only if the host implementation and the TOS stub
interface version match, the stub can be installed. The format of the version
string is MAJOR.MINOR, coded as a 16 bit value. 0x0105, for instance, means
version 1.05.

2. SCSI_INTERFACE_FEATURES

Returns the host's bus features, which depend on the host system, and the bus
name. For Linux the bus name is "Linux Generic SCSI".

3. SCSI_INQUIRE_BUS, SCSI_OPEN, SCSI_CLOSE, SCSI_ERROR, SCSI_CHECK_DEV

The host implementations of the corresponding SCSI Driver calls.

4. SCSI_INOUT

The host implementation of the SCSI Driver's In() and Out() calls. Except for
the data flow direction flag both calls are identical, so that they can be
mapped to the same interface all.

All SCSI Driver calls not listed above are implemented by the TOS stub.
Please refer to the source code (Hatari or ARAnyM, as well as the TOS stub)
for details.
