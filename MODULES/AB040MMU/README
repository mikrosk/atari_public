For SCSI transfers the PMMU of the Afterburner040 requires a special
initialization, in order to prevent caching of old data after loading new
data from a hard disk drive. Since HDDRIVER 12 this initialization is provided
by AB040MMU.PRG, which should be launched as first program in the AUTO folder,
or even better is launched as HDDRIVER module HDDRMOD0.SYS. In this case it
needs to be copied onto the boot partition. This is the same partition on
which HDDRIVER.SYS has been installed. In addition, ensure that in HDDRUTIL
the option for launching HDDRIVER modules is enabled before installing
HDDRIVER. Otherwise modules are not be executed.
AB040MMU.PRG or the module, resp., require HDDRIVER 12 or newer.
