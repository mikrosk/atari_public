HDDRIVER Driver Modules
-----------------------

Future versions of HDDRIVER will support starting programs, so-called
HDDRIVER driver modules, during the TOS boot sequence before the HDDRIVER.SYS
driver file. Typical candidates for HDDRIVER modules are SCSI Driver modules,
which provide access to non-standard bus interfaces. HDDRIVER scans all
available buses for devices, so that any mass storage device supported by a
SCSI Driver that was launched before by HDDRIVER is fully managed by
HDDRIVER, as if support for this device was built-in. Features like XHDI
support or booting the AUTO folder or ACCs from a partition on this device
will automatically be provided by HDDRIVER.

Since driver modules are executed before GEMDOS has fully been initialized
not all GEMDOS functionality is available during execution. In particular
filesystem access is not possible because no drives are present yet.

A driver module resembles a program that is usually located in the AUTO
folder. Programs in the AUTO folder, though, are started after the hard disk
driver, HDDRIVER driver modules are started before. The filenames of driver
modules must follow the naming convention "HDDRMODn.SYS" with n being a digit
from 0-9. n determines the execution order. During the boot process (if
HDDRIVER was configured accordingly) driver modules are executed until no
file for n was found. Only then HDDRIVER.SYS is executed.

Depending on the functionality it offers it is possible to run the same
binary from the AUTO folder or as driver module. MODSTART.S is a piece of
Pure C initialization code that enables a program to be executed by TOS and
as driver module. Please see the comments in the source code for details.
In particular MODSTART modifies the memory management of the program, so
that it is suitable to be executed during the boot process.

It is sufficient to just add MODSTART.S (or the corresponding MODSTART.O
object file) as the first item to the Pure C project file you are building
your program with. The MODSTART startup code automatically detects whether
the resulting binary was started by TOS or as a HDDRIVER driver module.
